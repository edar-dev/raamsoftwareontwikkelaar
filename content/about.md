:wave: Hello, I'm Edoardo, a Software Engineer, and this is my personal website.

:keyboard: The idea behind this website is to create a space for taking notes, primarily for myself, but it could also be helpful to others.

:round_pushpin: Based in the north of Italy, Italian is my mother tongue, but I'm also fluent in English and have a basic understanding of German.

:muscle: In my spare time, you'll often find me at the gym, where I enjoy staying fit and clearing my mind.

:mailbox: If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me at edoardo@arlati.dev.
