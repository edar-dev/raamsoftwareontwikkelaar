Hugo is a widely-used open-source static site generator, developed in the Go programming language. It's crafted to facilitate the creation of static websites effortlessly and efficiently. Unlike dynamic websites that generate pages dynamically, static site generators pre-generate HTML files for all site pages. This approach yields several benefits, such as enhanced performance, security, and simplicity. 
Thus, Hugo emerged as the ideal tool for my personal website and blog project.
