Embarking on my first Hugo project, I encountered my initial hurdle: configuring a proficient development environment.

Given Hugo's reputation for being lightweight and rapid, I opted for a **Cloud Development Environment**, ensuring accessibility from anywhere without the hassle of setup. My preferred choice? [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). However, if you lean towards a traditional local environment, fear not; you can seamlessly follow this guide.
